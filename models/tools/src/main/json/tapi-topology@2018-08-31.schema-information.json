The risk characteristics propagate from the physical realization to the client and from the server layer to the client layer, this propagation may be modified by protection. A TopologicalEntity may suffer degradation or failure as a result of a problem in a part of the underlying realization. The realization can be partitioned into segments which have some relevant common failure modes. There is a risk of failure/degradation of each segment of the underlying realization. Each segment is a part of a larger physical/geographical unit that behaves as one with respect to failure (i.e. a failure will have a high probability of impacting the whole unit (e.g. all cables in the same duct). Disruptions to that larger physical/geographical unit will impact (cause failure/errors to) all TopologicalEntities that use any part of that larger physical/geographical entity. Any TopologicalEntity that uses any part of that larger physical/geographical unit will suffer impact and hence each TopologicalEntity shares risk. The identifier of each physical/geographical unit that is involved in the realization of each segment of a Topological entity can be listed in the RiskParameter_Pac of that TopologicalEntity. A segment has one or more risk characteristic. Shared risk between two TopologicalEntities compromises the integrity of any solution that use one of those TopologicalEntity as a backup for the other. Where two TopologicalEntities have a common risk characteristic they have an elevated probability of failing simultaneously compared to two TopologicalEntities that do not share risk characteristics."]
