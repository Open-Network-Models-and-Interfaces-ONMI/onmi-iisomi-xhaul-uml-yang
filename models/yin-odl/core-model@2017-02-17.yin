    <description>
      <text>The FcSwitch class models the switched forwarding of traffic (traffic flow) between FcPorts and is present where there is protection functionality in the FC. 
If an FC exposes protection (having two or more FcPorts that provide alternative identical inputs/outputs), the FC will have one or more associated FcSwitch objects to represent the alternative flow choices visible at the edge of the FC.
The FC switch represents and defines a protection switch structure encapsulated in the FC. 
Essentially performs one of the functions of the Protection Group in a traditional model. It associates to 2 or more FcPorts each playing the role of a Protection Unit. 
One or more protection, i.e. standby/backup, FcPorts provide protection for one or more working (i.e. regular/main/preferred) FcPorts where either protection or working can feed one or more protected FcPort.
The switch may be used in revertive or non-revertive (symmetric) mode. When in revertive mode it may define a waitToRestore time.
It may be used in one of several modes including source switch, destination switched, source and destination switched etc (covering cases such as 1+1 and 1:1).
It may be locked out (prevented from switching), force switched or manual switched.
It will indicate switch state and change of state.
The switch can be switched away from all sources such that it becomes open and hence two coordinated switches can both feed the same LTP so long as at least one of the two is switched away from all sources (is 'open').
The ability for a Switch to be 'high impedance' allows bidirectional ForwardingConstructs to be overlaid on the same bidirectional LTP where the appropriate control is enabled to prevent signal conflict.
This ability allows multiple alternate routes to be present that otherwise would be in conflict.</text>

The FD object provides the context for and constrains the formation, adjustment and removal of FCs and hence offers the potential to enable forwarding. 
The LTPs available are those defined at the boundary of the FD.
At a lower level of recursion an FD could represent a fabric (switch matrix) in a Network Element (NE). 
An NE can encompass more than one switch matrix and hence more than one FD. The FD representing a switch matrix can be further partitioned.
The FD corresponds to a subnetwork [ITU-T G.800], FlowDomain [TMF 612] and a MultiLayerSubNetwork (MLSN) [TMF 612]. As in the TMF concept of MLSN and unlike the ITU-T concet of subnetwork model the FD can support more than one layer-protocol.</text>

      <text>The Network Element (NE) class represents a network element (traditional NE) in the data plane.
A data plane network element is essentially a consolidation of capabilities that can be viewed and controlled through a 'single' management-control port.
In the direct interface from an SDN controller to a network element in the data plane, the NetworkElement object defines the scope of control for the resources within the network element
For example internal transfer of user information between the external terminations (ports of the NE), encapsulation, multiplexing/demultiplexing, and OAM functions, etc. 
The NetworkElement provides the scope of the naming space for identifying objects representing the resources within the data plane network element.
NE is really a product bundling or some view of management scope, management access, session. 
The NE is not directly part of topology but brings meaning to the FD context and the LTP context (and hence the links).

      <text>Basic model representing a cable with connectors fitted where the cable is 'short' (e.g.  patch cord, in-station cabling).
This is intentionally a very basic representation of a cable. 
In a more sophisticated representation cable ends might be represented that then associate to the attached connector. 
At this point it is assumed that the basic model is sufficient.
